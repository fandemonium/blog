The flight back to China is always long. To make the trip a bit more bearable, I always flew from Chicago to Hong Kong directly to avoid any unnecessary detours. While the sceneries are good from time to time along the route, I have really reached my limits of taking creative photos. Due to various reason, I had to detour to Dallas, TX to fly to Hong Kong. I was really dreading it (Come on! Chicago is only 400 miles away!). However, the views were absolutely stunning (did I mention that I became bored of the views on the Chicago-HongKong route?) and I may consider this detour again next time. Here are some of my Ansel Adams moments.
