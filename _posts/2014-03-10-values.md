Lots of things happened this past week. Most important of all, Dr. Adina Howe gave some absolutely wonderful presentations on microbiome at Iowa State University. A great amount of interests were generated and many good questions were asked. Also from the Q&A sessions, I also had a glimpse of the side of the acadamic world that I am very not familiar with. It solely goes around two themes: 
	1. Is exploratory/discovery work interesting/exciting (however you want to call it...)?
	2. Is collaboratory work a waste time (is all about competition right...)?

Obviously, I'm biased towards the above questions.  I think exploratory/discovery work is an important step in pushing science forward and couldbe (or is) very exciting. I am very likely biased in this one because a large amount of my research exprience was at the exploratory/discovery level simply because the system and the field I was working in (and I am still working in...). In addition, I came from a multi-disciplinary background (microbiology, microbial ecology, engineering, and self-trained bioinformatics). I couldn't have done all these without an environment where multi-disciplinary training was highly encouraged.
